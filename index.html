					<p>Friends of Nevada Wilderness is very excited to be part of the new Nevada Chapter of Dark Sky International to help preserve dark skies and the public lands below. We were instrumental in establishing, with BLM, the <a href="https://www.nevadawilderness.org/massacre_rim_wsa_dark_sky_sanctuary">Massacre Rim International Dark Sky Sanctuary</a> in far NW Nevada. At the time, it was just the 7th certified sanctuary in the world!</p>
					 <p>The overwhelming public interest in the Sanctuary made us realize just how intrigued people from all over the world are by truly dark skies. We began to talk more about the importance of preserving Nevada’s uniquely dark skies and how low-impact astro tourism can help rural economies. We also began to work with DMV to create an official <a href="https://www.nevadadarksky.org/">Save Starry Skies license plate.</a> We’re thrilled that as of mid-2025, more than 3,000 plates have been registered and we’ve able to use proceeds to help promote and protect dark skies throughout the state. We have distributed hundreds of rack cards and Save Starry Skies brochures that talk about preservation and reducing light pollution.
					We look forward to supporting the great work being done all over Nevada to save our starry skies. </p>
